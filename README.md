# HW_OOP_2508
Create a program to keep a simple list of tasks (for today, for tomorrow, etc.).
The base class (Text) receives, contains and outputs the text of one task.
Derived classes:
"Important task" (GreatedTask), when displayed, an indication of importance is added (for example, exclamation marks);
"Urgent task" (DeadLineTask), a date field is added; "Daily Task" (DailyTask), a time field is added.
The program should generate a list of tasks and display this list on the screen.
